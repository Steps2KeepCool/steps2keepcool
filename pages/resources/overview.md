## Getting through the Climate Crisis towards a better civilization for all has many moving parts, including:

- Making food supplies that don't add to Climate Change

- Replacing 18th century energy sources that cause Global Warming with 21st century clean plentiful energy sources and systems

- Moving things and people around cleanly

- Making things and buildings cleanly

- Absorbing GHGs to stay cool enough by preserving and enhancing natural sinks (and maybe artificial for a time)

- Preserving natural systems to preserve a functioning ecosystem

- Expanding fulfilling human activities/jobs consistent with these, and helping people move to those jobs.

## Time to do these things is short for the size of the changes - need to make significant progress over the next decade
